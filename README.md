stream-java
===========

stream-java is a Java client for [Stream](https://getstream.io/).
The full documentation is available on [GetStream.io/docs](http://getstream.io/docs/).

### Introduction

Stream-java is a lightweight API client for [Stream](https://getstream.io/) built on top of two major
components:
- [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) is the fastest Json parser and data-binder for Java
- [Apache HttpClient 4.3](http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-4.3.x/index.html) is a mature and robust HTTP client for Java

In order to support Android devices we are currently implementing a version of stream-java using a [OkHttp](http://square.github.io/okhttp/).
Coming soon.
